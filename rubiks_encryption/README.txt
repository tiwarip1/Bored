This program is made in python and uses algoritms that simulates a 4x4 rubiks cube and takes a previously input password and turn it into\
binary, afterwhich these bits are placed on the face of the cube in a predefined order. The program then creates a set of rotations from a \
string that can be obtained through a a url. Once the manipulations have been made, the program provides the user a password that is \
completely different from the one they input through these manipulations.
